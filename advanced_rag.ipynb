    "Using a rerank model in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) solution can significantly improve the quality of the information provided to the language model. Here’s why it’s beneficial, particularly when reranking results from a vector database:\n",
    "1. Improved Relevance\n",
    "\n",
    "    Vector databases often return a list of documents using similarity search (e.g., cosine similarity in embeddings).\n",
    "\n",
    "    While this is efficient, the similarity score may not perfectly reflect relevance to the query’s intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A reranker uses a more sophisticated language model to assess the context, relevance, and alignment with the query, leading to a more accurate ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Contextual Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "    Rerank models, especially those based on transformer architectures like Cross-Encoders (e.g., BERT-based models), evaluate the query and documents together.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Unlike vector similarity that treats query and document embeddings independently, rerankers understand the relationship between them using deeper language understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "    This leads to better judgment of nuanced, contextual relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling Ambiguity\n",
    "\n",
    "    If the query is ambiguous, vector databases might return a broad set of results with varied relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A rerank model can prioritize results that are most likely to resolve the ambiguity by focusing on the query's intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Filtering Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "    Vector search may introduce irrelevant documents due to issues like semantic drift or embedding inaccuracies.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A reranker serves as a second layer of filtration, pushing low-quality results further down the list or removing them."

       "The Kingdom of Hungary was formed in the 10th century under King Stephen I, also known as Saint Stephen, who accepted Catholicism as its official religion and established a feudal system.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the 14th century, Charles Robert of Anjou was brought in to rule Hungary and introduced French and Italian ideas, leading to industrial immigration from Germany, Flanders, and Italy. The country became a Western state with a systematic fiscal policy based on gold production.\n",
       "\n",
       "Louis I, also known as Louis the Great, expanded Hungarian territory and assumed the Polish throne in 1370. He allied with Genoa and had a long struggle with Venice, which ended in the Peace of 1381.\n",
       "\n",
       "After Louis' death, his daughter Maria became queen, but her marriage to Sigismund of Luxemburg was soon challenged by Charles of Durazzo, who became king but was assassinated in 1385. This led to a Croatian revolt and Sigismund's return to power.\n",
       "\n",
       "However, Sigismund was often absent from the country and there was a decline in royal power. In 1396, Hungary suffered a disastrous loss in battle with the Turks, Dalmatia was taken by Venice again, and the Hussite invasions from Bohemia led to further instability.\n",
       "\n",
       "In the 19th century, Hungary's chief demand was for wider use of the Magyar language in administration, courts, and education. Lexicographers re-fashioned and enriched the native tongue, leading to a cult of language that also emphasized national costumes, dances, and other aspects of Hungarian culture.\n",
       "\n",
       "Count Istvan Szechenyi was a key figure in promoting Hungarian nationalism and reform. He advocated for Magyarism and reform under the blessings of the emperor, but his contemporary and eventual opponent, Lajos Kossuth, wanted complete liberty from Austria.\n",
       "\n",
       "In 1840, the government passed a law making Magyar the official language of all institutions in Great Hungary, giving the Croats six years to conform. The reaction was strong among non-Magyars, including Saxons, Slavs, and Romanians in Transylvania.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Revolution of 1848 led to Kossuth's reform of Hungary as a limited monarchy subject to the Austrian monarch but almost free internally. However, the Serbs and Croats rebelled against Hungary under Jellacic, who initially had Austrian help but later lost it as further revolt occurred in Austria.\n",
       "\n",
       "By 1867, Hungary recovered her integrity under Deak through the Ausgleich (compromise) of 1867, which gave Hungarians equal status with the German-speaking population. This began the \"Age of Dualism\" and marked the beginning of \"Austria-Hungary.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Magyarization followed, with changes in individual names and places to conform with the Magyar language.\n",
       "\n",
       "By 1900, Hungary had over a million workers in mining and industry, two universities, and several colleges of law, theology, and other disciplines. The country was led by figures such as Lorand Eotvds, a physicist, and Semmelweiss, a physician who worked in Vienna."

A.D. 901 TO 1000\\n24.4.1.2.3 HUNGARY\\nThe Magyars, who dominated and populated Hungary, raided far and wide between A.D. 937 and 955, going over all\\ncentral Europe and to Orleans and Tours in France, as well as south to Nimes and then down Italy to the tip of the heel,\\nbut they did not settle and the disruption was short-lived. (Ref. 8 ([14])) After they were defeated by the German Otto\\nin 955 they took up Christianity of the Latin variety, as they were afraid of Byzantium. Throughout all, however, they\\nretained their own Turko-Finnic (Magyar) language.\\nOn the political scene, Arpad, who had led the Magyars into Hungary in about 907, was followed eventually by a\\ngreat grandson, Duke Geisa, who established friendly relations with the Ottonian court and allowed some missionary\\nactivity from them. Geisa (also Geza) and his more famous son, Stephen (997-1038), welded the Magyars into a\\nkingdom. Stephen, whose original name was Vajk, before his baptism, married a Bavarian princess and in A.D. 1,001\\nwas crowned by the pope as King Stephen of Hungary10 (Ref. 119 ([166]))\\n24.4.1.2.4 CZECHOSLOV AKIA\\nThe Magyars of Hungary spent the opening years of the century destroying the Empire of Great Moravia. (Ref. 137\\n([188])) The creation of Bohemia (and Poland) by the Premyslid Dynasty was founded on agricultural development,\\nsuppression of tribal differences in spite of many independent tribal aristocracies and the inﬂuence of the Christian\\nchurch. When Bohemia was early threatened by the Magyars, Miesko I made his country a vassal of Germany and then\\nBohemia emerged as a stable unit after 929 under Boleslav of the Premyslid line. (Ref. 8 ([14])) Boleslav II founded\\nthe Bishopric of Prague, which resulted in the ﬁnal conversion of the entire area, including Poland and Hungary, to\\nLatin Christianity. Later in the century Bohemia became subject to the Polish ruler, as will be noted under EASTERN\\nEUROPE, this chapter.\\nLest we get carried away by the noble concept of kings and queens, nobles and bishops in this area of Europe, we\\nshould realize that these people were in many respects still fairly primitive and that cannibalism was not unknown.\\nSome bands sold human meat labeled \"pork\" or \"mutton\", and this practice was to continue for centuries. (Ref. 211\\n([284]))\\n24.4.1.2.5 SWITZERLAND\\nSwitzerland had no separate existence at this time with its territory split between the domains of the Saxon Dynasty\\nand the rulers of Burgundy. The relatively inaccessible Burgundy area was raided by Vikings, Moslems and ﬁnally\\nMagyars, all within about 50 years.

By the second\\nhalf of the century the Viking raids had diminished and western Europe recovered rapidly. The heavy mold-board\\nplow came into general use and made a great increase in agriculture possible, as drainage was obtained. Four oxen\\nand long ﬁelds were required for this type of plow. While the mer- chants of the other civilization of Eurasia were\\nprimarily caterers to the tastes of their social superiors and were accustomed to regulation and taxation from above in\\nthe \"command\" system, which we mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, the aggressive, ruthless and self-reliant\\nethos of western European merchants was profoundly different. The distinctive characteristics of subsequent western\\nhistory arise largely from this fact. (Ref. 8 ([14]), 139 ([192]))\\n10Stephen was canonized in 1083.

Industrial immigrants began to arrive from Germany,\\nFlanders and Italy. It was a century of some glory and essentially peace for Hungary and adjacent states. One-third of\\nall the gold production in the world, in the amount of 3,000 pounds each year, came from Hungary. Charles Robert\\nset up a systematic ﬁscal policy with that gold as a base. Charles’ son, Louis, although still an Angevin, became one\\nof the greatest kings and was called \"the Great\", chieﬂy because of territory gained and his added assumption of the\\nPolish throne in 1370. Some estimates give up to 3,000,000 people in Hungary by that time. The government was\\ntypical of European feudalism with nobles supplying military support for the monarch. Allied with Genoa, Louis\\nhad a long struggle with Venice which ended in the Peace of 1381 in which Venice ceded Dalmatia and paid tribute.\\nSerbia, Wallachia and Moldavia all recognized the suzerainty of Louis and he even had a victory over the Turks in\\nnorthern Bulgaria in 1366. At Louis’ death his daughter Maria became queen and married Sigismund of Luxemburgs\\nwho became guardian of the kingdom. This situation was soon challenged by Charles of Durazzo and Naples, who\\nhad a large following in southern Hungary and Croatia and he became king in 1385 only to be assassinated about a\\nyear later. This resulted in a Croatian revolt and it was 1387 before Sigismund regained control and this time assumed\\nthe throne, himself. He was absent from the country most of the time, however, and there was a marked decline in\\nroyal power. In 1396 there was a disastrous loss in battle with the Turks, Dalmatia was taken again by Venice and\\nthere were Hussite invasions from Bohemia as a result of Sigismund’s attempt to gain the Bohemian throne. (Ref. 119\\n([166]), 126 ([175]))\\n28.4.2.5.4 CZECHOSLOV AKIA\\nLike Austria, Bohemia was a part of the German Holy Roman Empire, but with its own king. After the death of\\nWenceslas III (1306), the ancient Przemyslid line ended and a foreigner, John of Luxemburg, son of Emperor Henry\\nVIII, was brought in to form a new dynasty, making Bohemia a part of the West. Limited in power by written law\\nand subject to actions of a national diet, he actually showed little concern for Bohemian affairs. In spite of this\\nBohemia became a power in international politics. John supported the Teutonic Knights against Lithuania and for a\\ntime ruled western Lombardy, as well as the Tyrol. He died in the battle of Crecy, ﬁghting on the side of the French.\\nHis son became King Charles I and soon Emperor Charles IV of the Holy Roman Empire. He was the greatest of\\nthe Bohemian kings, maintaining peace with the Germans, organizing good government, rebuilding and beautifying\\nPrague and founding the University of Prague as the ﬁrst university in central Europe. By the Golden Bull, initiated\\nin the empire in 1356 transforming it from a monarchy into an aristocratic federation with seven electors to vote on\\nthe emperor and other matters, the King of Bohemia was given ﬁrst place among those electors. Charles was a bright\\nyoung man in every way except as a military leader and was the last of the great medieval kings. His one black\\nmark was his subsidizing of the massacre of Jews and giving of their property to his supporters. His son and successor,\\nWenceslas IV , was a useless alcoholic and the remainder of the century was one of political chaos and degeneration. At\\nthe end of the century John Huss was pushing for the use of the vernacular in church liturgy and a religious movement\\nknown as Hussites began to form. Slavic nationalism rose in full force and added another disconcerting element.\\n(Ref. 8 ([14]), 119 ([166]))\\n28.4.2.5.5 SWITZERLAND\\nThe Swiss were the best soldiers in Europe and were frequently hired out as mercenaries and they repulsed all attempts\\nof the Austrian dukes to enforce feudal rights. In 1315, after defeating the Habsburg dukes by rolling rocks down the\\nhills on to the knights, at the battle of Morgarten, three cantons made the further step of forming the Swiss Confederacy,\\non their way to establishing the most stable and sensible democracy in history. Soon the original three cantons had\\nbeen joined by ﬁve others. The Confederacy, however, remained a part of the Holy Roman Empire, although the\\nsouthern communes emancipated themselves from the domination of the House of Habsurg by defeating Leopold II of\\nSwabia, in 1388. Blamed for spreading the Black Death, Jews were persecuted at Lake Geneva and Basel. (Ref. 222\\n([296]))\\n\\n\\n>>>>SOURCE QDRANT/world-history<<<: 686 CHAPTER 33. A.D. 1801 TO 1900\\n33.4.1.2.3 HUNGARY (Part of Austro-Hungarian Empire, and the previous paragraphs must also be read to\\nget a complete picture of Hungary at this period)\\nAfter 1790 the chief demand of the Hungarian Diet, whenever the Austrian emperor allowed it to meet, was for wider\\nuse of the Magyar language in administration, courts and education. Lexicographers re-fashioned and enriched the\\nnative tongue and the cult of language was accompanied by similar dedication to national costumes, dances and the\\nlike. The Croats in the empire fought the switch to the Magyar language and began to develop their own tongue,\\nalong with a sense of Pan-Slavism. Count Istvan Szechenyi was a great Hungarian nationalist whose books Kitel and\\nVilag started the \"Reform Era\" in Hungary in 1830. He desired Magyarism and reform, but under the blessings of the\\nemperor. His contemporary and eventual opponent, Lajos Kossuth, wanted progress and complete liberty from Austria.\\nIn 1840 the government passed a law making Magyar the ofﬁcial language of all institutions of Great Hungary. The\\nCroats were given 6 years to conform. The reaction of the non-Magyars, including the immigrant Saxons and Slavs\\nand the Romanians in Transylvania, was strong. Revolution broke out in Austria in 1848, along with that in much of\\nEurope, and Kossuth took advantage to reform Hungary as a limited monarchy subject to the Austrian monarch, but\\nin many internal respects, almost free. But the Serbs and Croats rebelled against Hungary under their leader, Jellacic.\\nAt ﬁrst he had Austrian help, but as further revolt occurred in Austria itself, this help soon dwindled and in the end\\nHungary triumphed, even temporarily breaking away from Austria. Franz-Joseph called on Russia for help and two\\nRussian armies entered Hungary, forcing Kossuth to surrender and he personally ﬂed to Turkey. By 1867 Hungary\\nhad re- covered her integrity under Deak, by the Ausgleich (compromise) of 1867, under which Hungarians won equal\\nstatus with the German speaking population. The situation had in part been promoted by the Empress Elizabeth, who\\nhad a real and compassionate interest in Hungary. Thus began the \"Age of Dualism\" and one might then truly speak\\nof \"Austria-Hungary\". Magyarization of all the people then followed, with changes of individual names and places to\\nconform with the Magyar language.\\nBy 1900 Hungary had over a million workers in mining and industry. There were two universities in Hungary proper,\\none in Croatia. There were a large number of colleges of law, theology, mining, etc. This was the time of the physicist\\nLorand Eotvds and the physician Semmelweiss, who was actually Hungarian, although part of his work was done in\\nVienna. Budapest was 79.8% Magyar speaking, but other ethnic frontiers remained on the east, north and west. Jews\\nmade up 4.9% of the overall population, 25% in Budapest and they had almost a monopoly in banking and ﬁnance.\\n(Ref. 126 ([175]), 8 ([14]))\\n33.4.1.2.4 CZECHOSLOV AKIA\\nThis area continued restlessly under the rule of the Austria-Hungarian Empire. Moravia was an important battle\\nground for Napoleon’s rout of the Russian and Austrian forces, in the ﬁrst decade of the century. After 1840 to 1850\\nthe rapid growth of cities in the Habsburg domains, together with the ravages of cholera resulted in peasant migration\\ninto the towns of Bohemia and Hungary to such an extent that the previous pattern of those people learning to speak\\nGerman and being \"Germanized\" was changed and a nationalistic ideal appeared. The result was that Prague became\\na Czech-speaking city within one-half century, just as Budapest had become a Magyar-speaking capital.\\nIn the last of the century there was growing business prosperity, with particular emphasis on textiles, shoes, cheap\\nchina and glass, sugar reﬁneries, breweries, coal and graphite mines and the great Skoda machine shop at Pilsen.\\nPrague University had new vigor with Professor Thomas Masaryk becoming one of the greatest of Czech philosophers\\nand patriots. He later became a member of the Austrian Parliament, promoting the Bohemian cause and in the next\\ncentury was to become the ﬁrst president of the Czechoslovakian Republic. In Moravia, there were riots in 1899 with\\nthe looting of Jewish and German houses so that troops had to be called out to restore order.\\n33.4.1.2.5 SWITZERLAND\\nWe noted in the last chapter that Napoleon had conquered Switzerland. In 1803 he allowed a satisfactory federal\\nconstitution and with Bonaparte’s fall, the Confederation was restored.

A.D. 1701 TO 1800\\nAleut males to help them hunt the otters in their ulluxtadags (similar to Eskimo kayaks) with harpoons and they then\\nmerged and lived together with the Aleuts. In 1784 Grigorii Shelekhov established a settlement on Kodiak Island and\\nfounded what became the Russian-American Company. They obtained otter and seal pelts, using 7,200 Aleuts to hunt\\nfull-time and taking 300 others as hostages to ensure work from the ﬁrst group. This broke up the Aleut families and\\nthen disease appeared, so that in the two generations at the end of the century, the Aleut population fell by nearly\\ntwo-thirds. (Ref. 234 ([311]), 199 ([272])) Shelekhov was followed by Alexander Baranov, who greeted British ships\\nand found English, American and even a few Spanish skippers had been trading for furs some 1,100 miles south. In\\n1799 he sailed along the shore with 450 two-man kayaks to establish a colony on Baranov Island, just 6 miles above\\na Tlingits Indian stronghold at what is now Sitka, Alaska. Those Tlingits had inhabited the lower coastal area of the\\nAlaskan panhandle for a long period and had a high culture, living in gabled lodges housing a dozen families and\\nproducing canoes holding 60 men. One of their better known features were their 50 feet tall totem poles. North of the\\nTlingits were the Eskimoes along the Arctic shoreline living, as the Aleuts on the islands, by hunting chieﬂy seals and\\nwalruses. In central Alaska were the Athabascan Indians, bearing no cultural resemblance to the coastal people. They\\nare linguistic cousins of the Apaches and Navajos and lived in small nomadic bands in bare simplicity, existing chieﬂy\\non the caribou. They did create the snow-shoe to facilitate getting about in deep snow. (Ref. 234 ([311])) Additional\\nNotes (p. 667)\\nBy 1745 when the Russians were already well established in the Aleutians, the English had only a handful of isolated\\ntrading posts west of Hudson Bay. (Ref. 8 ([14])) On the west coast of Canada, Don Juan Francisco de la Bodega\\nsailed the \"Sonora\" beyond the 56th degree latitude and examined the coast belonging to Russia,- which is now the\\nupper of British Columbia. Then in 1778 while Captain Cook was sailing up the coast to reach the Aleutians, he\\nincidentally discovered Nootka sound on Vancouver Island. Spanish historians claim, however, that Juan Perez had\\ndiscovered this sound previously in 1774.\\nOn the Atlantic side, in 1711 Britain attempted to take French Quebec and Canada, by sending seven regiments of\\nMarlborough’s best, along with 1,500 colonials into the St. Lawrence. Ten of their ships were sunk and the expedition\\nf ailed. The war in Europe ended 2 years later, however, and France’s position in southeastern Canada was greatly\\nweakened by the Treaty of Utrecht, which terminated the War of the Spanish Succession, or Queen Anne’s war, as it\\nwas called in America. (Ref. 222 ([296])) France lost Newfoundland,\\nNova Scotia and the Hudson Bay area to England and Canada as a whole was impoverished.\\nWhile thousands of sturdy Germans, French, Protestant Scots, etc., were pouring into the English colonies, the gov-\\nernment of Louis XV allowed only a mere trickle to go to Canada. The population of Canada in 1713 was only 18,119,\\nalthough this had doubled by 1734. In the 30 years after 1713 the French spent $6,000,000 in gold building a fortress\\non Cape Breton Island, which menaced English ﬁsheries, but was useless in war time. They also built forts on Lake\\nChamplain, at Niagara Falls and two on the Wabash. In 1744 the War of Jenkins’ Ear with Spain merged into the War\\nof the Austrian Succession (King George’s War in America) in which England and Austria were allies against France\\nand Prussia. The French and their Indian allies raided New England and the Iroquois raided Canada. The Treaty of\\nAix-la-Chapelle ended that war, with France retaining the Louisburg fort on Cape Breton Island. In mid-century the\\nEnglish settlers in Nova Scotia fought with the local French Acadians and the latter were deported in mass some 6,000\\nto 7 ,000 strong. Some ended up in Louisiana to became the \"Cajuns\". (Ref. 68 ([106]))\\nThe Seven Years War in Europe spilled over into the f inal French and Indian War in America (1755-1763) and the\\nPeace of Paris signed the death knoll for France in America. (Ref. 119 ([166])) Quebec had fallen in 1759 and\\nMontreal in 1760. (Ref. 8 ([14])) The French people in southern Canada, however, continued a self-consciousness\\nand intolerance, with their grievances carrying on to the present time. This was in spite of the fact that the British\\ngovernment, by the Quebec Act of 1774 guaranteed the French settlers free exercise of their religion, language and\\nlaw (Old French civil law), as well as expanding the boundaries of the new Canadian colony to the Mississippi and\\nOhio rivers. This, incidentally, was interpreted as harmful to Virginia and Pennsylvania and was one factor, along with\\nthe Coercive Acts, in lighting the fuse for revolution in the lower thirteen colonies. (Ref. 8 ([14])) Actually the British\\nwere not overjoyed with their conquest and tried to trade Canada back to the French, soon, in exchange for the island\\nof Guadeloupe. *** (Page 1201)\\n\\n',\n",

       " '>>>>SOURCE QDRANT/world-history<<<: 656 CHAPTER 32. A.D. 1701 TO 1800\\nthe Reverend Samuel Smith instructed them in the Creed, the Lord’s Prayer and the Commandments. This was about\\nthe extent of the Georgia conversion.\\nWe shall return to the traditional history of the American colonies, the problems in the \"Old Northwest\", the French and\\nIndians War and ﬁnally the American Revolution at a later time, but feeling that school texts have overlooked much\\nmaterial about the southern Indians and their relationships with the whites and imported Africans, we shall devote\\na few additional paragraphs to these subjects. At times the Indians cooperated with the British, as when Creeks,\\nYamacraws and Cherokees helped Oglethorpe in battles with Spanish troops, who attacked St. Simons Island in 1742.\\nNatives crewed the scout boats used for communications along the chain of sea island forts and they raided Florida,\\nkilling or capturing unwary Spaniards, Yamasees and Negroes. At other times the Indians fought the colonists, but in\\nbetween there was considerable merging of red, white and black races.\\nIn this 18th century Creeks constituted one of the largest racially heterogeneous tribes. Other more or less \"pure-bred\"\\ntribes, such as the Catawbas, had existed, but now there were only a few hundred of them left and the Catawba language\\nhad been lost. Various Catawbas conversed in assorted tongues belonging to several different language families. The\\nﬁrst mention of the term \"Seminole\" was in 1771 and it was probably taken from the Spanish cimarron (wild) which\\nbecame simanoli in Chickasaw. Lower and then Upper Creeks drifting into Florida formed the nucleus of the Seminole\\n\"nation\", with a few remnants from earlier days - Calusas and Tequestas. (See also page 1013). There never was a\\nuniﬁed Seminole nation and those Indians then, as today, did not necessarily understand one another. The Lumbees of\\nsoutheastern North Carolina offer an even more bizarre grouping. Numbering still some 40,000 today, they constitute\\none of the largest tribes in the United States, but actually they are an aggregation of diverse remnant tribes and also\\nblacks and whites, having geography more than anything else in common. There is no Lumbee language.\\nIt is thus apparent that the mixtures that developed among the southern Indians was not entirely one of intermingled\\ntribes, as the whites mixed with the natives on a much grander scale than some care to admit. A considerable numb er\\nof colonists married Indians and reared families and then, of course, the packhorsemen and factors, living for extended\\nperiods among the Indians, formed unions with native women. Many of the tribes had cultures which condoned\\npremarital sex for the young Indian girls. Such a large mestizo population emerged that great numbers of 18th century\\n\"Indian\" chiefs had such names as McDonald, Perryman, Colbert, Brown, etc. It wasn’t long before the natives and the\\nwhites and mestizos living among them began to insist that they owned their lands outright and that in every respect\\nthey inhabited a sovereign, independent nation. Attempts were made to reestablish centralized states, yet no chief\\nspoke for a uniﬁed Cherokee or Creek nation and colonists repeatedly took advantage of this to obtain lands. Many of\\nthe tribes were ethnic melting pots. The terms Creek and Muskhogee did not even appear until this century. Creek or\\nMuskhogee, the primary language, in all probability was not a ﬁrst language or perhaps even understood by a majority\\nof the Creeks. Lower Creeks, a major part of the confederation, themselves composed of different ethnic groups, for\\nthe most part spoke Hitchiti, which was unintelligible to those speaking Creek proper.\\nAt any time, in the last century or through this one, whenever whites destroyed Indian granaries and cut down their\\ncorn, the effect was devastating. Survivors ﬂed to the woods, where many starved, as they were not as at home in the\\nwoods as their hunting and gathering ancestors had been. The Cherokee Chief Vann was driven from his village during\\nthe revolution and was forced to scratch for subsistence in the wild. All of these Indians were basically agriculturists.\\nAlthough small amounts of wheat and rice were grown, maize remained the staple and was prepared as cornbread and\\nhominy, or after being boiled with oak and hickory ashes, was drunk as a kind of soup, which the Creeks called sof\\nkee. Late in the century sweet potatoes were developed. Fields were fenced and cattle, horses, sheep, goats, hogs and\\nchickens were available. The Upper Creek Chief Wolf owned 200 head of black cattle and Indians in other villages\\nhad even larger herds. A few years after the Revolution, William Augustus Bowles brought a large supply of munitions\\nand presents for the Creeks from the Bahamas, but they had to come to the coast to get them. They had no difﬁculty\\nin assembling more than 100 pack horses outﬁtted with saddles and halters had led them nearly 400 miles overland to\\npick up the goods. Of course, horse stealing became as prominent as raising, buying and selling. (Ref. 267 ([321]))\\nAlthough scalping was a long time custom among Indians, the usage increased after white contact and was more\\nprevalent around the time of the American Revolution than ever.

Some texts show close association of Hebrews to Canaanites before the time of Moses, and much of the\\nmoral teaching and ideals of justice of later Hebrew pro- phets were foreshadowed here and there are parallels to the\\nlater Biblical psalms, etc. (Ref. 95 ([140]), 87 ([132]))\\nThe timber resources of Lebanon were already considerably depleted by 2,000 B.C. but they have continued to be\\nexploited right down to the present time.

(Ref. 88 ([131]), 213 ([288]))\\n5.3.1.3 IRAQ AND SYRIA\\n5.3.1.3.1 1. MESOPOTAMIA, PROPER\\nThe term \"Sumerian\" has been coined by scholars from the place name of \"Sumer\" which by the third millennium was\\nused to mean southern Mesopotamia as apposed to Akkad, the northern part. Sumeria was a city civilization and the\\nimportant cities of Ur, Uruk, Larsa, Eridu and Kish had populations ranging from 15,000 to 250,000. One or more\\ntemple communities constituted a city, with priest administration and work-gangs to operate the irrigation system. The\\nland of the city was divided into several categories, with some ﬁelds owned by the gods and worked on their behalf,\\nsome ﬁelds rented out annually to individuals and others awarded to individuals, rent-free.\\nThe ﬁrst dynasty of Ur has been dated archaeologically and historically from the King- lists (royal genealogical tablets\\nfound on the site) to about 2,700 B.C., but there was a high civilization at Ur before this, perhaps with the city\\nfunctioning under the suzerainty of the Erech Dynasty. At least what appears to have been a royal cemetery has been\\nexcavated, dated prior to the ﬁrst dynasty of Ur, in which the ritual of burial included human sacriﬁce, varying from\\nsix to seventy or eighty people, sometimes including asses and carts with grooms and various women’s bodies. There\\nwas no evidence of violence; the men and women sacriﬁcial attendants probably simply drank a drug and went quietly\\nto sleep. Nothing like human sacriﬁce was ever mentioned from the later Sumeria. At any rate, the actual, historical\\nﬁrst dynasty of Ur was that of Mes-an-ni-pad-da of about 2,700 B.C. and it lasted supposedly for 177 years. During\\nthe later part of this time, at about 2,600 B.C. it had succeeded in conquering various surrounding areas, under King\\nUrukagina. This was followed by the usurpation of neighboring Umma by King Lugalzaggesi. Situated on the ﬂat\\nlands of the lower Euphrates, Sumer had no natural defenses and the cities became tempting objects of plunder to the\\nbarbarous people around. About 2,300 B.C. Sumeria was conquered by the neighboring Akkadians under their great\\nleader, Sargon I. The Sumerian culture seemed to continue in the new, combined empire, however, and a \"Golden\\nAge of Ur\" resulted. Sargon wrote of ships laden with goods in harbor at his capital and there were caravans of 200\\ndonkeys traveling 12 to 15 hours a day plying between Armenia and Iraq. From 2,112 to 2,015 B.C. Ur remained the\\ncapital of this great empire, ruled by the ﬁve kings of the third dynasty. Iraq had a population of between four and ﬁve\\nmillion at that time.\\nOne of the characteristic features of each great Sumerian city was the ziggurat and that of Ur has been the best\\npreserved. It has been suggested that if the Sumerians came originally from the Caucasus, one might assume that\\nthey felt that their gods had to have a mountain to stand or live on, and so they built the ziggurats, as substitutes. Ur\\nwas destroyed sometime after 2,000 B.C. and then for awhile it was under Isin lordship, then under the city of Larsa\\nand ﬁnally under the Elamites who came from south Persia. The Elamite prince, Warad-Sin, who became king of Ur,\\nrebuilt and enlarged the temples of the ancient city and his successor, Rim-sin served as king of Larsa also, and during\\nhis reign the population of the \"old town\" of Ur, that is, within the original walls, included an estimated 4,250 houses,\\nprobably with 34,000 people. The whole city, then, must have exceeded 250,000 and may have been twice that large. It\\nwas a manufacturing center with raw materials imported, sometimes from overseas via the Persian Gulf. Gold, copper\\nore, hard woods, ivory, pearls and precious stones were all brought by ship and recorded in bills of lading. (Ref. 238\\n([318]), 28 ([48]), 213 ([288]))\\nBut Ur was not to last much longer.

(Ref. 301 ([258]))\\nNOTE : A charter of 729 shows that King Offa was organizing defenses against pagan seamen early in the\\ncentury. The Lindisfarne attack is well documented by letters, but that was not the ﬁrst place to be raided in\\nwestern Europe, just one of the more extensive and noteworthy. (Ref. 301 ([258]))\\nNOTE : In addition to the previous trade items from Scandinavia there was now added walrus ivory from\\nnorthern Norway. There were signiﬁcant increases in imports of glass bowls, beakers, pottery, mill-stones\\nand silver coins from western Europe through Frisia to Denmark and Helgo in Lake Malaren in Sweden.\\nBoat-graves in the latter country contain such glass and coins. In Denmark there was built the Danevirke,\\na complex fortiﬁcation of timbers across the base of the peninsula, perhaps because of Charles Martel’s\\ncampaign against the Saxons in 738. The Limfjord was open at both ends and that was the normal route\\nfrom the North Sea to the Baltic. The trade route from Dorestadt up to Limfjord was well sheltered by\\nislands and from the eastern end of the Limfjord the course went down through either the Great or Little\\nBelt, where the exit was commanded by the island of Samso. This was bisected by a canal, either to facilitate\\ntribute or protection. In the east, Courland was subject to the Swedes and Staraja Ladoga was established in\\nthe last half of the century on the route leading to the rich fur areas of north Russia. The Danes and Swedes\\nfought each other almost continuously. King Anoundus of Sweden, exiled in Denmark, got 21 ships from\\nthe Danes to add to 11 of his own and returned to attack Birka. In some way this was diverted, however, and\\nhe attacked the Slavs instead. (Ref. 301 ([258]))\\nNOTE : About A.D. 770, after the Umayyads were overthrown by the Abbasids, Persian coins were once\\nagain in circulation throughout Russia.

They appear to have driven other Turkish tribes westward, including\\nthe Ogur and also their former rulers, the Juan-Juan of Mongolia. In the most northeastern part of Mongolia the\\nUigurs seized control in 744, establishing a capital on the Orkhon River near the site of later Karakorum. The most\\nfar ﬂung eastward group of Indo-European (Europoid) tribes were those who reached Chinese Turkistan and were\\ncalled Tocharians. Their language was written down in this century. The western region of Central Asia, Kashgar,\\nwas overtaken by the advance of Islam and due to the energy of the local emir (governor), considerable advance was\\nmade against the Turks. The Arabs controlled all of western Turkistan and Afghanistan and the Moslem religion has\\npersisted there until this day.\\nThe Arabs were helped in driving the Chinese out of west Turkistan by the Karluk Turks, who attacked the Chinese\\nfrom the rear. This Chinese army was ﬁnally completely defeated at the Talas River just south and west of Lake\\nBalkhash in A.D. 751 in one of those decisive battles of history. China was not to be inﬂuential in Central Asia for six\\ncenturies and Buddhism gave way to Islam. Of some importance, too, is the fact that some of the captured Chinese\\nsoldiers brought the art of making paper with them to the West.

The worsening climate had reduced productivity of\\nGreenland livestock and there was increasing navigational hazards from drift ice. Nevertheless, in 1432 a treaty had\\nbeen reached between the Norwegian and English kings in an effort to stop English pirates from roving the Davis Strait\\nand a papal letter of 1448 condemned these English pirates. All Greenland settlements were apparently abandoned by\\nabout 1500.\\nIn the arctic there were Thule Eskimos and Aleuts and in the subarctic regions there were many Indian tribes, including\\nKutchin, Kaska, Chipewyan and Cree. There seems no doubt that the Thule people, previously described as inhabiting\\nnorthern Canada and Greenland from at least A.D. 1000 onward, were the direct ancestors of todays Polar Eskimos,\\nwho live on Greenland’s northwest coast. The Thule, like the Dorset before them, were artists of ivory carving, both\\nfor implements and decorative pendants. Although they apparently originally had pottery when they lived primarily in\\nAlaska, their northeastern Canadian areas had a scarcity of clay and ﬁrewood, so they carved vessels out of soapstone\\nfor seal-blubber lamps, over which they boiled their meat or ﬁsh. At the end of this century large scale ﬁshing\\nenterprises began on the Newfoundland banks, where the warm waters of the Gulf Stream meet the colder arctic\\ncurrents and the cod survive in amazing numbers. Basques, French, Dutch and English all scufﬂed for dominance,\\nwith the Spanish Basques ﬁnally being driven out. (Ref. 260 ([29])) In 1497 Giovanni Cabato, a Genoese sailing\\nunder the British Union Jack and the anglicized name of John Cabot re-discovered Newfoundland and Nova Scotia\\nfor England. Three years later Corte-Real of Portugal explored the coast of Labrador. (Ref. 222 ([296])) On the\\nCanadian Paciﬁc coast there were the Tlingit tribes and on the Great Plains were Blackfoot, Ojibwa, Ottawa, Huron\\nand Micmac. The United States Apache are related to the Canadian Athapascan tribes, some of whom migrated to\\nreach the southwest (Arizona) in this 15th century. By the 1490s there were about 200,000 Indians spread over much\\nof Canada. (Ref. 8 ([14]), 189 ([259]), 93 ([137]))\\n29.9.1.1.2 THE UNITED STATES\\nTo supplement the remarks made in the paragraph above, in North America as a whole there were, in this century,\\nabout 1,000,000 Indians, with about 500 different languages. In northeastern United States there were Pottowatomie,\\nSusquehannock, Iroquois, Erie, Miami, Illinois and Shawnee. In the southeast were Chickasaw, Cherokee, Creek,\\nChocktaw, Natchez and others. In the far west were the Nes Perce, the California tribes of Pima, Yokuts, Chumash,\\nCochimi and then inland the Shoshone, Utes, Apache and in the central plains the Sioux, Cheyenne, Kiowa, Wichita,\\nComanche and many others. (Ref. 206 ([83]), 8 ([14]))\\nRegarding the Indians of the Great Plains, the Huff archeological site, some 20 miles south of Bismarck, N.D., shows\\na remarkable village built by the ancestors of the Mandan tribe and occupied from 1400 to 1600. House lodges still\\nnumber more than 100 and the Missouri River has been cutting away an untold number by eroding the bluff on which\\nthe houses rest. These structures averaged 38 feet by 30 feet, supported by central posts. The walls were of wattle and\\ndaubb and the roofs perhaps of sod. There is evidence of both horticulture and bison hunting. (Ref. 88 ([131]))\\nThe Mississippian Culture, which has been discussed in previous chapters, reached its climax about A.D. 1500, with\\nthe unique southern cult which included pyramids grouped around a central square or plaza with a wood, wattle and\\ndaub and thatch temple on its summit. These had a strong suggestion of inﬂuence from Mesoamerica. One of the most\\nnotable temple sites was Cahokia, at St. Louis, where groupings of pyramids and burial mounds cover several square\\nmiles. The largest is 104 feet high and covers 16 acres.\\nBizarre articles of copper, shell, stone, wood and clay in some mounds in the south show a preoccupation with violence\\nand death. Apparently southern Indians had kept captive slaves for centuries. For example: when the Whites arrived in\\nthe next century, the Lower Creeks had Yamasee slaves.

The Patzinaks (Pechnegi, Petchenegs) were a tough, nomadic\\npeople of the southern Ukraine, who if thirsty simply dismounted, opened their horses’ veins with a knife and drank\\nthe blood. They often ate the fattest of the horses, slightly warming the meat over a ﬁre. Later in the century they were\\nvirtually annihilated by the Emperor Alexius I. (Ref. 211 ([284]))\\nIn spite of the fact that the extreme south of Russia was held by the semi-barbarous tribes just mentioned, plus some\\nBulgars and Khazars, the Kievan state reached its zenith at this time with the absorption of the previous Scandinavian\\ninvaders and domination of both Slavic blood and speech. Even so, the Kievan Prince Yaroslav married the daughter\\nof the king of Sweden and gave hospitality to the exiled king of Norway. The social organization was aristocratic, the\\nRussian church powerful. After 1054 Russia had to choose in the religious quarrel between Rome and Constantinople\\nand went with the Greek Orthodox Church. In that same year, however, the last powerful ruler of Kiev died and power\\nfell to the Cuman Turks and the Orthodox world became divided in two. Almost all of the Russian princes had been\\ndefeated by these migrating Turks, speaking an east Turkic language, who had crossed into the Russian steppe at\\nabout 1060.

These Avars, soon ruling\\nfrom the V olga to the lower Danube, turned north and west until in 562 they came in contact with the Franks on the\\nElbe, establishing an extensive Avar Khanate.

North of the Khazar and the\\nnow separate Western Turkish Khanate were principally Finnish people, sparsely settled, while the Slavs were still\\nfarther west and dominated by the Avars.\\nThe Black Bulgars, originally a mixture of Huns, Ugrians and Turks, lived at this time in the valleys of the Don and\\nV olga rivers.

Ferghana, west of\\nthe Tarim Basin was the homeland of \"heavenly horses\" which the Chinese felt they had to have in their cavalry to\\ncounteract the agile ponies of the Hsuing-nu and other raiding - nomads. At the end of the century Wu-Ti sent armies\\nto subdue the nomads of Sinkiang and go through this area to get the horses. A Chinese explorer had reached this\\nFerghana Valley in 128 B.C. and a military garrison had been established by 101 B.C.

In far\\nnorthwest Greenland a group known simply as Polar Eskimos lived in complete isolation, using sea-mammal bones\\nfor sled runners and using nets to catch cliff-dwelling birds.

Margaret, daughter of Denmark’s Valdemar IV , was married at ten years of age to King\\nHaakon VI and ten years later she had a son, Olaf, who became king of Denmark when Valdemar died and then king of\\nNorway when Haakon died. When Olaf expired in 1387, Margaret was elected as Queen, thus introducing the system\\nof election already in practice in Denmark and Sweden.\\n28.4.2.7.2 SWEDEN\\nMagnus II became the Swedish king in 1319 at the age of three years, with his mother as regent and effective ruler.\\nThrough his mother Magnus also succeeded to the Norwegian crown and during a troubled period in Denmark actually\\ngained Scania, Halland, and Bleking temporarily for Sweden. Even after he assumed the reign for himself, there was\\na deﬁnite weakening of the royal power and a rise of the aristocracy. The ﬁrst meeting of the Riksdag, which included\\nnobles and burghers, was in 1359. By 1363 Magnus was deposed and succeeded by Albert of Mecklenburg, who was\\nalways a tool of the nobility. They eventually dethroned him in 1388, calling in Margaret, already Queen of Norway\\nand regent of Denmark, thus uniting all three countries. Ofﬁcially she formed the Union of Kalmar in 1387 under the\\nname of her grand-nephew and adopted son, Eric of Pomerania, but she retained the effective power. Additional Notes\\n(p. 478)\\n28.4.2.7.3 DENMARK\\nThe successful reign of Eric Menved ended in 1320 by capitulation and Christopher II was elected, with limitations\\nlaid down by the nobility and clergy. In 1340 Christopher was driven from the throne by Gerhard, Count of Holstein.\\nThis was indicative of the dominance of the German Hansa towns in Danish politics at that time. From 1332 to 1340\\nDenmark was in a state of anarchy, with no king and actually ruled by German Counts from adjacent territories. The\\nScanian provinces across the sound placed themselves under the Swedish king, Magnus Smek, as a separate province.\\nBut then came Valdemar IV , the youngest son of Christopher, to take the throne as one of the greatest Danish kings. The\\nChurch was subordinated to the royal power and the nobles and towns were made to perform their military obligations\\nas Valdemar reconquered the territories lost by his father, in wars with Sweden, Holstein and Schleswig. In 1361 he\\neven took on the Hansa. Copenhagen was sacked but the Danes defeated the Hansa ﬂeets in 1362 at Helsingborg.\\nValdemar had been raised at the Imperial German court as a European man of fashion; his wife was a Schlesvig\\nprincess. Although not liked much by the Danes, he ruled efﬁciently. During his reign he sold Estonia to German\\nnobles, then conquered the Goths of Gotland, an island in the Baltic which was actually a part of Sweden although\\ncontrolled by the Hanseatic League. The second war with the Hansa occurred from 1368 to 1370 and this time the\\nLeague was supported by Sweden, Norway, Holstein, Mecklenburg and even by some of the Danish nobles. Badly\\ndefeated, Valdemar accepted the Peace of Stralsund which again made the Hansa supreme in the Baltic. Valdemar’s\\ngrandson, Olaf, ruled from 1376, under the regency of his mother, Margaret, until his death in 1387 when Margaret\\nbecame queen, ruling also in Norway and Sweden.

Even by 1665 Quebec contained only 70 houses\\nand 550 people. The French fur traders, however, soon carried their commerce 2,000 miles inland to the Tetons. They\\ncould live on the barest vegetation and in the crudest shelter, in terrible weather. It was those French guides who later\\nstaffed the Lewis and Clark expedition. (Ref. 151 ([206]), 39 ([60])) In 1685 the governor of Canada wrote to Louis\\nXIV complaining that the colonial French had not civilized the Indians, but on the contrary, the Frenchmen who lived\\namong the savages themselves became savages. (Ref. 217 ([68]))\\nThroughout the entire ﬁrst 2/3 of the century New France had to continually ﬁght the Five Nations of the Iroquois\\nLeague and largely because of this the Hundred Associates gave up in 1663 and surrendered their charter, allowing\\nCanada to become a crown colony of Louis XIV . In 1665 the Marquis de Tracy arrived with 800 soldiers to wage a\\ntotal war campaign against the Iroquois, killing and burning their ﬁelds and villages. (Ref. 39 ([60])) The new military\\nregime was absolute, with severe laws stringently enforced by torture, when necessary. The Marquis’ chief claim to\\nfame is that he brought girls along to be the soldiers’ wives and these, along with a few descendants of extraneous\\nunions of coureurs de bois with young Indian girls, are primarily the ancestors of all present day French-Canadians.\\nRobert Cavelier de La Salle, born at Rouen and educated in a Jesuit seminary, emigrated to Canada early in life and\\nfrom letters brought to life much later, it is apparent that he started his ﬁrst exploratory trip south from Canada as\\nearly as 1671. In 1675 he visited France and received a grant of the government and property at Fort Frontenac (now\\nKingston, Ontario), which had been previously established in 1672 under the name of Fort Cataraqui. La Salle rebuilt\\nthe fort and in the spring of 1678 was commissioned to undertake the exploration of the Mississippi River. (Ref. 63\\n([93])) We shall here more of him in the next section.\\nThe ﬁrst commercial venture into the Hudson Bay area was in 1668 when Fort Charles was built by Scottish en-\\ntrepreneurs. Two years later the Hudson Bay Company was chartered with title to nearly 1.5 million square miles of\\nterritory.

Most of the tribes\\nof the northern United States and southern Canada belonged to the Algonquian linguistic stock, comprised of the\\nMicmacs, Wabanakis, Etchemis, Montaignais, Natick, Abnaki, Massachuset, Penobscot, Wamponoag and Delawares,\\nin the eastern area. The original name for the Delawares was \"Lanape\" and there is some evidence that they may\\nhave had some contact with the Dutch as early as 1609. Squeezed between the New York state Iroquois League, the\\nSusquehannocks and the more southern Powhatan Confederacy, part of the Lenape moved on west and part stayed to\\nbecome dependent on and eventually in some degree to fuse with the European settlers. (Ref. 253 ([16])) The early\\nhistory of the Shawnees is not known with certainty, but they considered the Delewares their \"grandfathers\". By 1650\\nthey were living in southern Ohio and northern Kentucky where they remained for several years.

They carved ﬁgures\\nof animals from walrus’s tusks and bone, decorating them with peculiar outer marks which Schledermann (Ref. 189\\n([259])) has called an outline of animals’ skeletons. In the pictures he shows, however, it hard to identify true skeletal\\nstructures and the marks are more reminiscent to this writer of the lunar notations of ancient Europeans described\\npreviously by Marchack. (Ref. 139 ([192])) The northwest American Indians of the Canadian waterways continued in\\nactive existence at this time.\\n14.9.1.1.2 THE UNITED STATES\\nAccording to Barry Fell’s original hypothesis North American trade from southern Europe ceased after the conquest\\nof Brittany (55 B.C.) and the Battle of Actium (31 B.C.) because the Romans had no navy and needed none and the\\nmemory of America was lost17. In his latest book of 1980, however, Fell (Ref. 66 ([97])) revises this markedly, having\\nallegedly recently been deluged with ﬁnding of European (Roman) coins and rock inscriptions in a great variety of\\nplaces in North America. Rock engravings which he believes to be copies of multiple coins minted locally in Spain\\nabout 20 B.C. in imitation of Roman coins of the same era and bearing portraits of Caesar Augustus, have been found\\nat Castle Gardens, Wyoming. Fell is convinced that this Wyoming site was actually an early bank and center of trade\\nwith customers using Celtiberian Gaedelic as their main language. He hypothesizes that people of Wyoming traded\\nwith Celtiberians and their Indian wives, after the latter had migrated across the continent from New England to British\\nColumbia and then to northwest United States. West Arkansas and Oklahoma have also yielded coins which seem to\\nﬁt into this same category. Lacking further conﬁrmation, the reader may make his own interpretation.\\nIn the central and eastern United States there was continued Hopewell expansion with a distinctive ritual and artistic\\ntradition, probably indicating a loosely knit group of societies with common religious and artistic conventions. The\\nGulf states, too, were heavily inhabited probably as far back as this era. In southern Colorado the Anasazi people\\nentered into what we have already labeled the Basket-maker period. Excavations at Durango show both cave and open\\nvillage sites, with evidence of maize growing as well as hunting activities. Baskets were made of plant ﬁbers loosely\\nplaited, coiled or stitched and decorated in red and black. (Ref. 215 ([290]), 45 ([66]), 210 ([283]))\\nThe Mogollon Culture in southern New Mexico and eastern Arizona apparently developed from the Cochise Culture\\nand was manifested by a sedentary life style utilizing a plain pottery and existing on maize along with the fruits of\\nsome gathering and hunting. The name \"Mogollon\" is one lately applied 18, and ﬁrst given to a range of mountains\\nrunning almost east-west across central Arizona and New Mexico, marking the southern edge of the northern high\\nplateau country. South of this Mogollon ridge the terrain drops several thousand feet into the southern basin with\\nmeager rainfall and hot desert valleys with desert grasses, mesquite and cactus. In the middle of that basin there\\nare north-south running mountain ranges going from New Mexico well down into Old Mexico. About 100 B.C. the\\nMogollon Indians have been identiﬁed as inhabiting this region. They continued to live in that large area for 1,500\\nyears, constantly improving their crops and tools.\\nAt about the same time another group of Indians, who may have been still another branch of the ancient Cochise,\\nsettled in the hot arid valleys of the lower Gila and Salt rivers. They have become known as the Hohokam19, surviving\\nthrough their descendants, the Pima and the Papago.

The Adams - Jackson political campaign of 1828 was the most\\ndegrading experience of an election that the United States had experienced. Jackson was ill-educated, intolerant\\nand rough, yet professing the principles of the Declaration of Independence and devoted to the union. Jacksonian\\ndemocracy was the upsurge of a new generation of recently enfranchised voters against a somewhat ossiﬁed Jefferson\\nRepublican party. (Ref. 151 ([206])) Jackson Democrats believed in equality only for white men and they introduced\\nthe spoils system into federal government, catered to mediocrity and diluted politics with the incompetent and the\\ncorrupt. The jackass as a symbol of the Democratic party was ﬁrst used by the opposing Whigs as a satire on the\\nsupposed ignorance of \"Old Hickory\". Two vital issues of that time were:\\n1. Nulliﬁcation. First set forth in the Exposition of 1828 by the legislature of South Carolina, this stated that each\\nstate had the right to judge when its \"agent\", the federal government, exceeded its powers and then to take\\nmeasures to prevent enforcement within state limits. Calhoun was the secret author. Jackson threatened the use\\nof army and navy in a showdown in 1833 and South Carolina backed down\\n2. The Bank of the United States. Jackson forced the demise of the previously well run U.S. Bank by denying it\\ngovernment funds. Local banks, released from control, increased paper credit for speculation in western lands\\nand shortly there- after the ﬁnancial panic of 1837 burst upon the country. Van Buren, a shrewd, able and\\ndigniﬁed president spent the whole of his administration developing a substitute for the Bank of the United\\nStates. He was also the principal architect of the modern American political party\\nAndrew Jackson hated the British and all Indians, due to several unfortunate incidents in his childhood. It was an\\nalmost foregone conclusion, therefore, that when the whites wanted more land for cotton in the south that Jackson\\nshould outlaw the tribal kingdoms of the Choctaws, Creeks, Chickasaws and Cherokees in Mississippi, Alabama and\\nGeorgia. The Indians appealed to the Supreme Court and Chief Justice John Marshall upheld their claim, but Jackson\\npaid no attention and ordered the army \"to get them out\". 30,000 of those Indians were driven, one way or another on\\nthe \"Trail of Tears\" to Oklahoma and one quarter of them died on the trip. (Ref. 151 ([206]), 39 ([60])) The common\\nimpression that after the 1830s all Southern Indians had been either killed or removed to Oklahoma is misleading,\\nhowever, because some 74,000 are still present in the South today, living in loose, ill-deﬁned clusters, such as the\\nCreeks around Poarch, Alabama and the Lumbees south of Fayetteville, North Carolina or on reservations. It was\\nduring Jackson’s administration that the Second Seminole War was fought in 1835. Abolitionists charged that this\\nwas really not an Indian but a Negro war, resulting from southern white determination to capture and enslave Negro-\\nSeminoles.

As a concession from Napoleon, it was agreed\\nthat Norway should be associated with Sweden under the Bernadotte rule. We have seen above that Norway resisted\\nthis arrangement. In 1810 Bernadotte, whose wife was once Napoleon’s ﬁancé and was a sister-in-law to Joseph\\nBonaparte, became Crown Prince, changing his name to Karl Johann (Charles John).

When\\nhe had been in England, he had bought about 40,000 modern ﬂintlocks with bayonets and he used those remaining\\nafter the Narva battle as models, constructing 6,000 in 1701 and turning out 40,000 a year by 1711. One-fourth of\\nall the church bells in Russia were melted down to make new cannons, with 20 new ones available by May, 1701.\\nIn the next three years seven new iron works were developed beyond the Urals, using good ore, perhaps even better\\nthan Sweden’s23. Peter received no help from Holland or the Habsburgs in this period, because they were involved\\nwith most of the rest of Europe in the War of the Spanish Succession. He did get some reassurance from his old ally,\\nAugustus II of Poland. However, when the allies defeated Sweden, Russia got only Ingria and had to supply 15,000 to\\n20,000 infantrymen for the Saxons, besides paying Augustus a war subsidy of 100,000 rubles a year for 3 years.\\nDuring the 6 years that Karl XII of Sweden was ﬁghting in Poland, Peter had some small military successes, including\\nthe standing off of a Swedish naval expedition at Archangel and some victories against the 7,800 Swedes left to hold\\nLivonia, taking some Swedish prisoners back to Moscow and eventually completely destroying the rest of that Swedish\\narmy, using savage Kalmuch and Cossack horsemen. In 1702, with a ﬂeet of small gun- boats built on the south shore\\nof Lake Lagoda, the czar attacked a Swedish squadron of three brigantines and three galleys, forcing the Swedes to\\nwithdraw down the Neva River, leaving the great lake to the Russians. After similar attacks the Swedes also had to\\nwith- draw from Lake Peipus, only to return in 1703 and again be run out by the Russians.\\nPeter had gained his opening to the Baltic by taking Fort Noeteborg (renamed Schluesselburg) and he soon controlled\\nthe ancient area of Ingria, along with the area where he was soon to build a city, St. Petersburg, at the mouth of the\\nNeva. That city is at the same latitude as Hudson’s Bay and when built, New York was already 77 years old and Boston\\n73. The ﬁrst digging for the new city was in May, 1702 on Hare Island. Although still occasionally under attack by\\nSwedes, the new city received its f irst merchant ships for trade in 1703.

Fires were common and the czar\\nhimself of ten led the ﬁreﬁghters. Floods were also frequent and devastating, with the entire town sometimes under\\nwater. In the area around St. Petersburg, most of the original Finns had been eliminated by war and plague24 and Peter\\ngave their land to noblemen and ofﬁcers who often then brought whole villages of peasants to live there.\\nThe czar had to control Livonia and Estonia to safeguard his new city and to accomplish this while still administering\\nthe entire country meant that he had to travel constantly.\\nExcept in winter, travel was extremely difﬁcult and hazardous,- with rutted or muddy roads, worn out bridges, crude\\nferries and fords and few fresh horses. His whole concern was war and taxes to support war. The money came\\nfrom an increasing number of state monopolies, with the state taking control of production and sale of innumerable\\ncommodities from alcohol to chessmen, salt and furs25. Many people revolted, some escaping to the north and east to\\njoin the \"old Believers\", others even organized true revolts, including a rebellion at Astrakhan and the uprising of the\\nBashkir (semi-orientals between the V olga and the Urals), as well as the Don Cossack revolt under Kondraty Bulavin.\\nAll were put down in one way or another, the latter one with the help of other loyal Cossacks under Hetman Maximov.\\nFor that, Maximov was later executed by Bulavin.\\nIn the interval af ter Peter defeated the Swedish king at Narva and after the cessation of the War of the Spanish\\nSuccession, Peter tried to make deals with any and every European power for help against further Swedish advances,\\nbut he had no luck.

Additional Notes (p. 55)\\nIn the United States area big game hunting continued throughout this period but with a gradual decrease in the number\\nof animals available. By 8,000 B.C. North American Indian culture was already divided into three great patterns:\\n• Eastern Woodlands, which will later be called \"Archaic\"\\n• Desert, possibly related to Eastern Woodland\\n• Western Paleo-Indian\\nAlthough the Eastern Woodlands actually existed from 8,000 B.C. to about 1,000 B.C., during this 8,000 to 5,000 B.C.\\nperiod under discussion it was called \"Early Archaic\" and was characterized by big game hunting with ﬁshing and\\nshell and plant gathering. Burial mounds were being built in eastern Canada by 5,000 B.C. (Ref. 213 ([288])) In the\\nmid-west there was a related sub-culture called \"Modoc\", with evidence of mano and metate (stone mortar and pestle)\\nexisting about 7,200 B.C. Another variation existed in the Ozarks, Oklahoma and Mississippi. Additional Notes (p.\\n55)\\nThe Western Paleo-Indian Culture was originally a big game hunting tradition congregated in the Great Basin lying\\nbetween the Cascade Mountains of southern Oregon and the Rockies of Idaho and running south through Nevada,\\nwestern Utah and the eastern part of California. The \"Old Cordilleran Tradition\" is a name given to the culture of\\nIndians in the Oregon and Washington areas dating from 7,800 to 5,700 B.C. who used characteristic ﬂaked stone\\npoints known as \"Cascade points\". Around 7,000 B.C. some of the hunters from the Great Basin area migrated south\\ninto the mountains and tablelands of the southwest- i.e. southern Colorado and Utah, along with Arizona, New Mexico\\nand the Mexican states of Sonoro and Chihuahua. This migration was probably precipitated by weather changes which\\nwere making semi-arid deserts of the previous great savannahs of the Basin, and the consequent disappearance of the\\ngame. One large branch of these ancient immigrants to the southwest has been given the name recently of \"Cochise\"\\n(from a county in Arizona). The so-called Sulfur Springs Phase of this culture ran from 7,000 to 5,000 B.C. and was\\na society dependent on hunting ancient horses, mammoths, antelope and bison with ﬂaked projectile points. The Lake\\nMojave area of southern California has yielded kite-shaped points, choppers, drills and scrapers, some of which have\\nbeen dated back to 9,000 B.C. At 6,000 B.C. the climate changed with a marked rise in temperature associated with\\ndrought. The great herds died out including the mastodons and camels. Many areas were denuded and there was a\\nshifting of Indian population and a change in their living patterns.

Before the development of pottery some peoples may have used\\nanimal stomachs as liquid containers to hang over ﬁres. In the same valley there is evidence of the use of six food\\nresources–the maguey plant, cactus fruits (prickly pear), tree legumes like the mesquite, wild grasses, deer and rabbits.\\nCultivated plants probably made up only 5% of the diet, as opposed to 54% from hunting and 41% from collecting\\nwild plants. The common bean and maize were introduced into the valley about 5,000 B.C. Maize apparently went\\nunder considerable genetic change with cultivation, but since it lacks an important amino acid, it was fortunate for the\\nIndians that it was eaten in connection with beans, which supplied the deﬁcit.

Of greatest importance, however, was the\\nmigration of the Amorites who came out of the desert about 2,100 B.C. to take over most of the entire area, including\\nthe city of Babylon and then the entire Euphrates Valley. (Please see paragraphs above on Mesopotamia, proper (p.\\n76).)\\nFinally, coming out of their original homeland east and north of Lake Van (Armenia) as early as the late 3rd mil-\\nlennium B.C. were an Asianic-speaking people called Hurrians, who settled in large numbers in northern Syria and\\nMesopotamia. Although the Hurrians, themselves, may well have been of the old, original Caucasian race, they ap-\\nparently had an aristocracy of Indo-European origin called \"Mitanni\". By 1,600 B.C. they had a series of kingdoms.\\nSome authorities believe that they introduced the horse and chariot to the Near East as war vehicles. What is often\\ncalled the Mitanni Kingdom was actually a federation of Hurrian states under the kings of Wahukanni. At one period,\\nKing Tushratta captured and held the stone capital of Assyria, Nineveh. (Ref. 136 ([187]), 45 ([66]))\\n5.3.1.4 IRAN (PERSIA)\\nThe Bronze Age on the plateau of central Iran began about 3,000 B.C. A basic agricultural economy was soon aug-\\nmented by export of lapis lazuli from the northeast and steatite (soapstone) from the southeast. The metal industry\\nfollowed that of Elam and Babylonia. The Elamite civilization with its capital at Susa continued to ﬂourish in a limited\\ngeographical area and their antagonisms and military vigor were manifested in their raids of Sumer. The Mitanni and\\nthe Hurrians lived in parts of northern Iran before their migrations into northern Syria. Writings appeared early in\\nPersia, notably in the region of Elam, where the cultural relations were closer to Mesopotamia than to the remainder\\nof Persia. Elamites also had indirect trade with Egypt. (Ref. 18 ([31]), 45 ([66]))\\nThe linguist, Pei (Ref. 168 ([229])), believes that the Indo-European peoples and their basic language originated by\\nabout 2,500 B.C. either on the Iranian plateau or about the Baltic Sea, while Wells (Ref. 229 ([307])) would put\\nthe date several thousand years earlier (See also Eastern Europe (p. 84)). McEvedy (Ref. 136 ([187])) indicates a\\nsouthern Russia and lower central Asian origin around the Aral Sea, with these early Indo-Europeans, which he labels\\n\"Iranians\", as beginning migrations from central Asia down into Iran by 2,250 B.C. and even pushing into Syria by\\n1,600 B.C. Their gray Gurgan pottery is found at the excavation site of Tepe Hissar just south and east of the Caspian\\nSea. These same Iranians spread across central Asia, becoming the base population of the steppe, while another\\nsegment moved south, eventually invading India. As the Iranians stormed into the Middle East at the end of the time\\nperiod under review, they were accompanied by clans of the Caucasian Kassites and Hurrians, with war chariots.\\n(Please also see Europe: 5000 to 3000 B.C.

This Dorset Society was to last overall,\\nsome sixteen centuries. (Ref. 189 ([259]))\\nBy this century, for reasons unknown, the Adena Culture had faded and almost disappeared, but a new North American\\nIndian culture made its appearance in Illinois and soon spread to Ohio. Named the \"Hopewell\" after an Illinois mound\\ngroup, this eventually spread widely over a huge portion of the eastern United States, stretching from the Mississippi\\nRiver to Florida. Although the people probably cultivated corn and other crops, hunting and gathering were still\\nof critical importance. They built elaborate earthworks, some for defensive purposes and some as burial mounds.\\nThey worked in copper, mica, obsidian, soap-stone and wood as well as clay. Copper and mica cutouts in various\\ndesigns were seen in efﬁgy pipes and occasional pottery. Rock carvings of satyr masks almost identical with some of\\nCarthaginian occupied Sardinia and Carthaginian coins of the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. have allegedly been found\\nalong the Arkansas River both above and below Wichita, Kansas, according to Barry Fell, and he feels positive that\\nthe Carthaginians traded on the Atlantic side of America for lumber, gold and furs. (Ref. 45 ([66]), 66 ([97]))\\nIn the southwest, in southern New Mexico and eastern Arizona, Coshise Indians continued their agricultural, hunting\\nand gathering society, but with still more improvement in the type of corn, squash and beans, so that a true farming\\ncommunity had materialized.\\n12.9.1.2 MEXICO AND CENTRAL AMERICA\\nAs the Mayan Society began to ﬂourish we must not fail to remember that the Olmecs left a heritage of religious beliefs,\\nartistic symbolism and other cultural traditions to all subsequent Mexican people. Recent excavations near Coba,\\nMexico, on the Yucatan peninsula have been called the Late Pre-classic Maya period by Mexican archeologists, with\\na dating going back to 300 B.C. and with a peak at A.D. 200. The Mayas excelled in astronomy and developed a very\\ncomplex system of chronology (perhaps originating with the Olmecs) which was remarkably exact in its calculation.\\nFor example, they calculated that 405 full moons occurred in a period of 11,900 days, while today astronomers make\\nit 11,959,888 days, thus differing by 1 day every 292 years or less than ﬁve minutes a year! They recorded their\\nlanguage in a complex hieroglyphic script composed partly of ideograms representing whole words or ideas and partly\\nof phonetic symbols for sounds, much as did ancient Egyptian and modern Japanese. Scholars are still working on\\ndecoding this language, which is still spoken by some two million people. (Ref. 176 ([242]))\\nIn Costa Rica this Middle to Late Period IV can be viewed as a time of contact with more developed Mesoamerican\\ncultures. Superb human and zoomorphic ceramic efﬁgies were produced at this time. In the Central Highlands-\\nAtlantic Watershed, household remains also resemble Mesoamerican patterns; small, rectangular houses are sometimes\\naccompanied by bell-shaped storage pits. The pottery was adorned with any number of tropical reptiles with the color\\nchieﬂy red on buff. (Ref. 265 ([270])) The archeological record of western Panama begins at about 300 B.C. and\\nincludes ceramics found in the Rio Chiriqui rockshelters. They were similar to those described in Costa Rica. We\\nshall note in later chapters that this was an area where big chiefdoms developed. (Ref. 266 ([67]))\\n12.9.1.3 SOUTH AMERICA\\nThere were apparently any number of small, localized although prosperous societies in various parts of the Ecuador,\\nPeru, Bolivia complex in this century. About this time a numerous tribe arrived in the Chilca Basin just south of present\\nday Lima, building clusters of dwelling houses made of conical, hand molded clay blocks, a temple and store-house-\\nfortress. Their temple resembled a Polynesian \"marae\", and large and impressive adobe pyramids were constructed.\\nThere were perhaps 2,500 people to a village, living on corn, sea-food and potatoes of cultivated species, the ﬁrst in\\nPeru. Seven Lapa Lapa15 systems with some 10,000 structures made of heavy stone have been mapped out. They had\\nsome traits in common with the Nazcas who lived farther south and were their contemporaries - such things as pipes\\nwith ten holes, triangular obsidian projectile points and certain types of dishes.

Other southerners, however, argued that the question was not whether slaveholders\\nwould\\nwant to move to the lands of the Mexican Cession, but whether they could and still retain control of their\\nenslaved property. Denying them the right to freely relocate with their lawful property was, they maintained,\\nunfair and unconstitutional.

Noyes claimed to have achieved this state of perfection in 1834.\\nNoyes applied his idea of perfection to relationships between men and women, earning notoriety for his\\nunorthodox views on marriage and sexuality. Beginning in his home town of Putney, Vermont, he began to\\nadvocate what he called “complex marriage:” a form of communal marriage in which women and men who had\\nachieved perfection could engage in sexual intercourse without sin. Noyes also promoted “male continence,”\\nwhereby men would not ejaculate, thereby freeing women from pregnancy and the difficulty of determining\\npaternity when they had many partners.

Individuals who wanted to join the Oneida Community underwent a tough screening\\nprocess to weed out those who had not reached a state of perfection, which Noyes believed promoted self-\\ncontrol, not out-of-control behavior. The goal was a balance between individuals in a community of love and\\nrespect.

The\\nprogram, which focused on teaching students about Mexican American history and literature, was begun in 1998,\\nto convert high absentee rates and low academic performance among Latino students, and proved highly\\nsuccessful. Public school superintendent Tom Horne objected to the course, however, claiming it encouraged\\nresentment of White people and of the U.S. government, and improperly encouraged students to think of\\nthemselves as members of a race instead of as individuals.\\nTucson was ordered to end its Mexican American studies program or lose 10 percent of the school system’s\\nfunding, approximately $3 million each month. In 2012, the Tucson school board voted to end the program. A\\nformer student and his mother filed a suit in federal court, claiming that the law, which did not prohibit programs\\nteaching Native American students about their culture, was discriminatory and violated the First Amendment\\nrights of Tucson’s students. In March 2013, the court found in favor of the state, ruling that the law was not\\ndiscriminatory, because it targeted classes, and not students or teachers, and that preventing the teaching of\\nMexican studies classes did not intrude on students’ constitutional rights. The court did, however, declare the\\npart of the law prohibiting classes designed for members of particular ethnic groups to be unconstitutional.\\nWhat advantages or disadvantages can you see in an ethnic studies program?

It also\\nsought to establish English as a “common and unifying language” for the nation. The bill and a similar\\namended version both failed to become law.\\nWith unemployment rates soaring during the Great Recession, anxiety over illegal immigration rose, even\\nwhile the incoming flow slowed. State legislatures in Alabama and Arizona passed strict new laws that required\\npolice and other officials to verify the immigration status of those they thought had entered the country\\nillegally. In Alabama, the new law made it a crime to rent housing to undocumented immigrants, thus making\\nit difficult for these immigrants to live within the state. Both laws have been challenged in court, and portions\\nhave been deemed unconstitutional or otherwise blocked.\\nBeginning in October 2013, states along the U.S.-Mexico border faced an increase in the immigration of\\nchildren from a handful of Central American countries.

The Missouri territory had been part of the Louisiana Purchase and was the first part of\\nthat vast acquisition to apply for statehood. By 1818, tens of thousands of settlers had flocked to Missouri,\\nincluding slaveholders who brought with them some ten thousand enslaved people. When the status of the\\nMissouri territory was taken up in earnest in the U.S. House of Representatives in early 1819, its admission to\\nthe Union proved to be no easy matter, since it brought to the surface a violent debate over whether slavery\\nwould be allowed in the new state.\\nPoliticians had sought to avoid the issue of slavery ever since the 1787 Constitutional Convention arrived at an\\nuneasy compromise in the form of the “three-fifths clause.” This provision stated that the entirety of a state’s\\nfree population and 60 percent of its enslaved population would be counted in establishing the number of that\\nstate’s members in the House of Representatives and the size of its federal tax bill. Although slavery existed in\\nseveral northern states at the time, the compromise had angered many northern politicians because, they\\nargued, the “extra” population of enslaved people would give southern states more votes than they deserved in\\nboth the House and the Electoral College. Admitting Missouri as a slave state also threatened the tenuous\\nbalance between free and slave states in the Senate by giving slave states a two-vote advantage.\\nThe debate about representation shifted to the morality of slavery itself when New York representative James\\nTallmadge, an opponent of slavery, attempted to amend the statehood bill in the House of Representatives.\\nTallmadge proposed that Missouri be admitted as a free state, that no more enslaved people be allowed to enter\\nMissouri after it achieved statehood, and that all enslaved children born there after its admission be freed at\\nage twenty-five. The amendment shifted the terms of debate by presenting slavery as an evil to be stopped.\\nNorthern representatives supported the Tallmadge Amendment, denouncing slavery as immoral and\\nopposed to the nation’s founding principles of equality and liberty. Southerners in Congress rejected the\\namendment as an attempt to gradually abolish slavery—not just in Missouri but throughout the Union—by\\nviolating the property rights of slaveholders and their freedom to take their property wherever they wished.\\nSlavery’s apologists, who had long argued that slavery was a necessary evil, now began to perpetuate the idea\\nthat slavery was a positive good for the United States. They asserted that it generated wealth and left White\\nmen free to exercise their true talents instead of toiling in the soil, as the descendants of Africans were better\\nsuited to do. Enslaved people were cared for, supporters argued, and were better off exposed to the teachings\\nof Christianity as enslaved than living as free heathens in uncivilized Africa. Above all, the United States had a\\ndestiny, they argued, to create an empire of slavery throughout the Americas. These proslavery arguments\\nwere to be made repeatedly and forcefully as expansion to the West proceeded.\\nMost disturbing for the unity of the young nation, however, was that debaters divided along sectional lines, not\\nparty lines. With only a few exceptions, northerners supported the Tallmadge Amendment regardless of party\\naffiliation, and southerners opposed it despite having party differences on other matters. It did not pass, and\\nthe crisis over Missouri led to strident calls of disunion and threats of civil war.\\nCongress finally came to an agreement, called the Missouri Compromise, in 1820. Missouri and Maine (which\\nhad been part of Massachusetts) would enter the Union at the same time, Maine as a free state, Missouri as a\\nslave state. The Tallmadge Amendment was narrowly rejected, the balance between free and slave states was\\nmaintained in the Senate, and southerners did not have to fear that Missouri slaveholders would be deprived of\\ntheir human property.

This speech, known as the “Peace without Victory” speech, extolled\\nthe country to be patient, as the countries involved in the war were nearing a peace.

The connection between gay men and GRID—later renamed human\\nimmunodeficiency virus/autoimmune deficiency syndrome, orHIV/AIDS—led straight people and\\nmainstream news organizations to largely ignore the growing health crisis in the gay community, wrongly\\nassuming they were safe from its effects. The federal government also overlooked the disease, and calls for\\nmore money to research and find the cure were ignored.\\nEven after it became apparent that straight people could contract the disease through blood transfusions and\\nheterosexual intercourse, HIV/AIDS continued to be associated primarily with the gay community, especially\\nby political and religious conservatives.

Few Americans wished to participate in the devastating battles that ravaged Europe, and Wilson did\\nnot want to risk losing his reelection by ordering an unpopular military intervention. Wilson’s “neutrality” did\\nnot mean isolation from all warring factions, but rather open markets for the United States and continued\\ncommercial ties with all belligerents. For Wilson, the conflict did not reach the threshold of a moral imperative\\nfor U.S. involvement; it was largely a European affair involving numerous countries with whom the United\\nStates wished to maintain working relations. In his message to Congress in 1914, the president noted that\\n“Every man who really loves America will act and speak in the true spirit of neutrality, which is the spirit of\\nimpartiality and fairness and friendliness to all concerned.”\\nWilson understood that he was already looking at a difficult reelection bid. He had only won the 1912 election\\nwith 42 percent of the popular vote, and likely would not have been elected at all had Roosevelt not come back\\nas a third-party candidate to run against his former protégée Taft. Wilson felt pressure from all different\\npolitical constituents to take a position on the war, yet he knew that elections were seldom won with a\\ncampaign promise of “If elected, I will send your sons to war!” Facing pressure from some businessmen and\\nother government officials who felt that the protection of America’s best interests required a stronger position\\nin defense of the Allied forces, Wilson agreed to a “preparedness campaign” in the year prior to the election.\\nThis campaign included the passage of the National Defense Act of 1916, which more than doubled the size of\\nthe army to nearly 225,000, and the Naval Appropriations Act of 1916, which called for the expansion of the\\nU.S. fleet, including battleships, destroyers, submarines, and other ships.\\nAs the 1916 election approached, the Republican Party hoped to capitalize on the fact that Wilson was making\\npromises that he would not be able to keep. They nominated Charles Evans Hughes, a former governor of New\\nYork and sitting U.S. Supreme Court justice at the time of his nomination. Hughes focused his campaign on\\nwhat he considered Wilson’s foreign policy failures, but even as he did so, he himself tried to walk a fine line\\nbetween neutrality and belligerence, depending on his audience. In contrast, Wilson and the Democrats\\ncapitalized on neutrality and campaigned under the slogan “Wilson—he kept us out of war.” The election itself\\nremained too close to call on election night. Only when a tight race in California was decided two days later\\ncould Wilson claim victory in his reelection bid, again with less than 50 percent of the popular vote. Despite his\\nvictory based upon a policy of neutrality, Wilson would find true neutrality a difficult challenge. Several\\ndifferent factors pushed Wilson, however reluctantly, toward the inevitability of American involvement.\\nA key factor driving U.S. engagement was economics. Great Britain was the country’s most important trading\\npartner, and the Allies as a whole relied heavily on American imports from the earliest days of the war forward.\\nSpecifically, the value of all exports to the Allies quadrupled from $750 million to $3 billion in the first two\\nyears of the war. At the same time, the British naval blockade meant that exports to Germany all but ended,\\ndropping from $350 million to $30 million. Likewise, numerous private banks in the United States made\\nextensive loans—in excess of $500 million—to England. J. P . Morgan’s banking interests were among the largest\\nlenders, due to his family’s connection to the country.\\nAnother key factor complicating the decision to go to war was the deep ethnic divisions between native-born\\nAmericans and more recent immigrants. For those of Anglo-Saxon descent, the nation’s historic and ongoing\\nrelationship with Great Britain was paramount, but many Irish-Americans resented British rule over their\\nplace of birth and opposed support for the world’s most expansive empire. Millions of Jewish immigrants had\\nfled anti-Semitic pogroms in Tsarist Russia and would have supported any nation fighting that authoritarian\\nstate. German Americans saw their nation of origin as a victim of British and Russian aggression and a French\\ndesire to settle old scores, whereas emigrants from Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire were mixed in\\ntheir sympathies for the old monarchies or ethnic communities that these empires suppressed. For\\ninterventionists, this lack of support for Great Britain and its allies among recent immigrants only\\nstrengthened their conviction.\\nGermany’s use of submarine warfare also played a role in challenging U.S. neutrality.

As\\nwith Chopin and Harding Davis, Dunbar’s writing highlighted parts of the American experience that were not\\nwell understood by the dominant demographic of the country.

U.S. History covers key forces\\nthat form the American experience, with particular attention to issues of race, class, and gender. It is designed\\nto provide a balanced approach, both confronting difficult and oppressive aspects of our history and\\ncelebrating those who overcame them.\\nPreface 1\\n\\n',\n",
       " '>>>>SOURCE QDRANT/us-history<<<: political cartoon Southern Chivalry: Argument versus Club’s (Figure 14.1). Note the title of the cartoon; it\\nlampoons the southern ideal of chivalry, the code of behavior that Preston Brooks believed he was following in\\nhis attack on Sumner. In Sumner’s “Crime against Kansas” speech he went much further than politics, filling\\nhis verbal attack with allusions to sexuality by singling out fellow senator Andrew Butler from South Carolina, a\\nzealous supporter of slavery and Brooks’s uncle. Sumner insulted Butler by comparing slavery to prostitution,\\ndeclaring, “Of course he [Butler] has chosen a mistress to whom he has made his vows, and who, though ugly to\\nothers, is always lovely to him; though polluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight. I mean the harlot\\nSlavery.” Because Butler was aged, it was his nephew, Brooks, who sought satisfaction for Sumner’s attack on\\nhis family and southern honor. Brooks did not challenge Sumner to a duel; by choosing to beat him with a cane\\ninstead, he made it clear that he did not consider Sumner a gentleman. Many in the South rejoiced over\\nBrooks’s defense of slavery, southern society, and family honor, sending him hundreds of canes to replace the\\none he had broken assaulting Sumner. The attack by Brooks left Sumner incapacitated physically and mentally\\nfor a long period of time. Despite his injuries, the people of Massachusetts reelected him.\\nTHE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 1856\\nThe electoral contest in 1856 took place in a transformed political landscape. A third political party appeared:\\nthe anti-immigrant American Party, a formerly secretive organization with the nickname “the Know-Nothing\\nParty” because its members denied knowing anything about it. By 1856, the American or Know-Nothing Party\\nhad evolved into a national force committed to halting further immigration. Its members were especially\\nopposed to the immigration of Irish Catholics, whose loyalty to the Pope, they believed, precluded their loyalty\\nto the United States. On the West Coast, they opposed the entry of immigrant laborers from China, who were\\nthought to be too foreign to ever assimilate into a White America.\\nThe election also featured the new Republican Party, which offered John C. Fremont as its candidate.\\nRepublicans accused the Democrats of trying to nationalize slavery through the use of popular sovereignty in\\nthe West, a view captured in the 1856 political cartoon\\nForcing Slavery Down the Throat of a Free Soiler (Figure\\n14.15). The cartoon features the image of a Free-Soiler settler tied to the Democratic Party platform while\\nSenator Douglas (author of the Kansas-Nebraska Act) and President Pierce force an enslaved person down his\\nthroat. Note that the enslaved person cries out “Murder!!! Help—neighbors help, O my poor Wife and Children,”\\na reference to the abolitionists’ argument that slavery destroyed families.\\nFIGURE 14.15 This 1856 political cartoon, Forcing Slavery Down the Throat of a Free Soiler, by John Magee, shows\\nRepublican resentment of the Democratic platform—here represented as an actual platform—of expanding slavery\\ninto new western territories.\\nThe Democrats offered James Buchanan as their candidate. Buchanan did not take a stand on either side of the\\nissue of slavery; rather, he attempted to please both sides. His qualification, in the minds of many, was that he\\nwas out of the country when the Kansas-Nebraska Act was passed. In the above political cartoon, Buchanan,\\nalong with Democratic senator Lewis Cass, holds down the Free-Soil advocate. Buchanan won the election, but\\nFremont garnered more than 33 percent of the popular vote, an impressive return for a new party.

Two important\\ntribes have accepted the provision made for their removal at the last session of Congress, and it is believed that\\ntheir example will induce the remaining tribes also to seek the same obvious advantages.”\\nThe Cherokee decided to fight the federal law, however, and took their case to the Supreme Court. Their legal\\nfight had the support of anti-Jackson members of Congress, including Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, and they\\nretained the legal services of former attorney general William Wirt. In\\nCherokee Nation v. Georgia, Wirt argued\\nthat the Cherokee constituted an independent foreign nation, and that an injunction (a stop) should be placed\\non Georgia laws aimed at eradicating them. In 1831, the Supreme Court found the Cherokee did not meet the\\ncriteria for being a foreign nation.\\nAnother case involving the Cherokee also found its way to the highest court in the land. This legal\\nstruggle—\\nWorcester v. Georgia—asserted the rights of non-natives to live on Native American lands. Samuel\\nWorcester was a Christian missionary and federal postmaster of New Echota, the capital of the Cherokee\\nnation. A Congregationalist, he had gone to live among the Cherokee in Georgia to further the spread of\\nChristianity, and he strongly opposed Native American removal.\\nBy living among the Cherokee, Worcester had violated a Georgia law forbidding White people, unless they were\\nagents of the federal government, to live in Native American territory. Worcester was arrested, but because his\\nfederal job as postmaster gave him the right to live there, he was released. Jackson supporters then succeeded\\nin taking away Worcester’s job, and he was re-arrested. This time, a court sentenced him and nine others for\\nviolating the Georgia state law banning White people from living on Native land. Worcester was sentenced to\\nfour years of hard labor. When the case of\\nWorcester v. Georgiacame before the Supreme Court in 1832, Chief\\nJustice John Marshall ruled in favor of Worcester, finding that the Cherokee constituted “distinct political\\ncommunities” with sovereign rights to their own territory.\\nChief Justice John Marshall’s Ruling in\\nWorcester v . Georgia\\nIn 1832, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court John Marshall ruled in favor of Samuel Worcester in Worcester v.\\nGeorgia. In doing so, he established the principle of tribal sovereignty. Although this judgment contradicted\\nCherokee Nation v. Georgia, it failed to halt the Indian Removal Act. In his opinion, Marshall wrote the following:\\n“From the commencement of our government Congress has passed acts to regulate trade and intercourse with\\nthe Indians; which treat them as nations, respect their rights, and manifest a firm purpose to afford that\\nprotection which treaties stipulate. All these acts, and especially that of 1802, which is still in force, manifestly\\nconsider the several Indian nations as distinct political communities, having territorial boundaries, within which\\ntheir authority is exclusive, and having a right to all the lands within those boundaries, which is not only\\nacknowledged, but guaranteed by the United States. . . .\\nThe Cherokee Nation, then, is a distinct community, occupying its own territory, with boundaries accurately\\ndescribed, in which the laws of Georgia can have no force, and which the citizens of Georgia have no right to enter\\nbut with the assent of the Cherokees themselves or in conformity with treaties and with the acts of Congress. The\\nwhole intercourse between the United States and this nation is, by our Constitution and laws, vested in the\\ngovernment of the United States.\\nThe act of the State of Georgia under which the plaintiff in error was prosecuted is consequently void, and the\\njudgment a nullity. . . . The Acts of Georgia are repugnant to the Constitution, laws, and treaties of the United\\nStates. ”\\nHow does this opinion differ from the outcome of\\nCherokee Nation v. Georgia just one year earlier? Why do you\\nthink the two outcomes were different?\\nDEFINING AMERICAN\\n10.4 • Indian Removal 259\\n\\n',\n",

Schools purchased dog tags to help\\nidentify students in the aftermath of an attack and showed children instructional films telling them what to do\\nif atomic bombs were dropped on the city where they lived.\\n“ A Guide for Surviving Nuclear War”\\nTo prepare its citizens for the possibility of nuclear war, in 1950, the U.S. government published and distributed\\ninformative pamphlets such as “A Guide for Surviving Nuclear War” excerpted here.\\n“Just like fire bombs and ordinary high explosives, atomic weapons cause most of their death and damage by\\nblast and heat. So first let’s look at a few things you can do to escape these two dangers.\\nEven if you have only a second’s warning, there is one important thing you can do to lessen your chances of injury\\nby blast: Fall flat on your face.\\nMore than half of all wounds are the result of being bodily tossed about or being struck by falling and flying\\nobjects. If you lie down flat, you are least likely to be thrown about. If you have time to pick a good spot, there is\\nless chance of your being struck by flying glass and other things.\\nIf you are inside a building, the best place to flatten out is close against the cellar wall. If you haven’t time to get\\ndown there, lie down along an inside wall, or duck under a bed or table. . . .\\nIf caught out-of-doors, either drop down alongside the base of a good substantial building—avoid flimsy, wooden\\nones likely to be blown over on top of you—or else jump in any handy ditch or gutter.\\nWhen you fall flat to protect yourself from a bombing, don’t look up to see what is coming. Even during the\\ndaylight hours, the flash from a bursting A-bomb can cause several moments of blindness, if you’re facing that\\nway. To prevent it, bury your face in your arms and hold it there for 10 to 12 seconds after the explosion. . . .\\nIf you work in the open, always wear full-length, loose-fitting, light-colored clothes in time of emergency. Never\\ngo around with your sleeves rolled up. Always wear a hat—the brim could save you a serious face burn.”\\nWhat do you think was the purpose of these directions?

Why do you think officials tried to convey\\nthe message that a nuclear attack was survivable?\\nGovernment and industry allocated enormous amounts of money to the research and development of more\\npowerful weapons. This investment generated rapid strides in missile technology as well as increasingly\\nsensitive radar. Computers that could react more quickly than humans and thereby shoot down speeding\\nmissiles were also investigated. Many scientists on both sides of the Cold War, including captured Germans\\nsuch as rocket engineer Werner von Braun, worked on these devices. An early success for the West came in\\n1950, when Alan Turing, a British mathematician who had broken Germany’s Enigma code during World War\\nII, created a machine that mimicked human thought. His discoveries led scientists to consider the possibility\\nof developing true artificial intelligence.\\nHowever, the United States often feared that the Soviets were making greater strides in developing technology\\nwith potential military applications.
